PICO Unity Integration SDK developed by PICO for the PICO VR headset, derived from Pico's git repo at https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-Integration-SDK
 
This version of the SDK was slightly modified to support some needed functionality for Bertec-branded products and deliverables, and should not be used outside of that context.
